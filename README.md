# ND1309 C2 Ethereum Smart Contracts, Tokens and Dapps - Project Starter 
**PROJECT: Decentralized Star Notary Service Project** - For this project, you will create a DApp by adding functionality with your smart contract and deploy it on the public testnet.

### StarToken

#### ERC721 Token Name
StarToken

#### ERC721 Token Symbol
STK

#### “Token Address” on the Rinkeby Network
0x86dd6a780310F674129bA148e015EE385d66Eba4


### Dependencies

1. **Node:** - v16.14.0
```

2. **Truffle:** -  v5.4.29 


3. **Metamask:** - v10.16.1 


4. **Solidity:** - v0.5.16 


5. **Other mandatory packages**:
    "openzeppelin-solidity": "2.3",
    "truffle-hdwallet-provider": "^1.0.17",
    "web3": "^1.3.5"


### Run the application
1. Clean the frontend 
```bash
cd app
# Remove the node_modules  
# remove packages
rm -rf node_modules
# clean cache
npm cache clean
rm package-lock.json
# initialize npm (you can accept defaults)
npm init
# install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json
npm install
```


2. Start Truffle by running
```bash
# For starting the development console
truffle develop
# truffle console

# For compiling the contract, inside the development console, run:
compile

# For migrating the contract to the locally running Ethereum network, inside the development console
migrate --reset

# For running unit tests the contract, inside the development console, run:
test
```

3. Frontend - Once you are ready to start your frontend, run the following from the app folder:
```bash
cd app
npm run dev
```

---

### Important
When you will add a new Rinkeyby Test Network in your Metamask client, you will have to provide:

| Network Name | New RPC URL | Chain ID |
|---|---|---|
|Private Network 1|`http://127.0.0.1:9545/`|1337 |

The chain ID above can be fetched by:
```bash
cd app
node index.js
```

## Troubleshoot
#### Error 1 
```
'webpack-dev-server' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```
**Solution:**
- Delete the node_modules folder, the one within the /app folder
- Execute `npm install` command from the /app folder

After a long install, everything will work just fine!


#### Error 2
```
ParserError: Source file requires different compiler version. 
Error: Truffle is currently using solc 0.5.16, but one or more of your contracts specify "pragma solidity >=0.X.X <0.X.X".
```
**Solution:** In such a case, ensure the following in `truffle-config.js`:
```js
// Configure your compilers  
compilers: {    
  solc: {      
    version: "0.5.16", // <- Use this        
    // docker: true,
    // ...
```
